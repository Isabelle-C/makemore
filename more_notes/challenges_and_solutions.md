# Challenges and Solutions
1. Weight initialization 
Weight initialization details is more important if your output layer has the (saturating) tanh non-linearity and an MSE error on top of it.
2. Overfitting Solutions
- Data augmentation: a fairly simple and very standard concept
-Â Dropout
- Large-scale optimization
    - Residual connections
    - Layer/batch normalization
